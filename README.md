# SkillExchange

**Purpose of the app:** The purpose of SkillExchange is to provide users an opportunity to exchange lessons in their own hobbies and interests with each other. This allows users to learn a new craft or skill by paying with their time instead of with their money.

**How to use:** Users have the option to register or log in. Once logged in, the user is redirected to the home page where they can add a skill to teach. They can select skills from a variety of categories and then add a description about their specific skill and duration of time which they are available to teach it. Users can then go to the User Profile page to see a list of their skills. This is where they can edit or delete their skill. When users are ready to make a skill trade with another user, they can navigate to the Trade page. The Trade page allows users to select a category of skill which they would like to learn. Once a category is selected, descriptions of lessons offered by other users in that category are displayed along with an email button. A user can then select the email button which will allow them to send an email to the user offering the skill of interest.

**Features:** node.JS, mustache-express, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, sequelize, express, express-sessions, elephantSQL
